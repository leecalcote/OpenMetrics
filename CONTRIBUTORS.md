As we are a reasonably random bunch of people interested in the same thing, this file should serve as a starting point to know who people are.

  Currently focusing on building a new datacenter for SpaceNet, Richard comes from the networking side of things and has been on call 24/7 for over a decade in his last life. He learned the hard way that precise monitoring which supports operations is key to keeping people sane, and allowing them both sleep and a social life.
* Brian Brazil
  Prometheus core developer, with over a decade of experience working with this style of monitoring. He wants to encourage a more modern way of doing metrics, and avoid the numerous anti-patterns we're left with due to previous styles of monitoring.

Advanced and emerging technologies have been a consistent focus through Calcoteâ€™s tenure at SolarWinds, Seagate, Cisco and Pelco.
